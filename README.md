\# WFSL Device Health Guard



Deterministic device health validation and compliance guard for WFSL systems.



WFSL Device Health Guard evaluates the operational health, configuration

integrity, and compliance posture of engineering workstations and managed

devices used within WFSL-governed environments.



All assessments are deterministic and derived from declared checks,

verified system state, and WFSL governance rules.
